## Portfolio Project
Assignment done with the intentions of building a portfolio demonstrating what I've learned in HTML/CSS 
up until this point.

# Comments
Overall, this project required a lot of trial and error which gave me an opportunity to practice, practice, 
practice. Though I do feel like I'm getting more and more comfortable, sometimes troubleshooting in CSS 
does take some time. Overall, I'm statisfied with how it came out. I do feel like, visually, there is room for
improvement but I'm happy with the hours I put in to this cause I learned a lot. I tired to create a basic 
layout for now and build off it when I get free time. 

update 7/11/21: Scrapped the entire layout and design of my original portfolio design. Added some javascript to it. I know more projects will be added in the future but I want to continue to push the overall design.
